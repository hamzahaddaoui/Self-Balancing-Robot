# Self Balancing Robot

## Abstract
For the final project of high school, given my passion for robotics, I decided to devote myself to the study and construction of a self-balancing robot, a particular automaton able to keep itself balanced on two wheels, managing to win the their condition of instability. 
The condition of equilibrium is achieved through the use of sensors capable of detecting, moment by moment, the angle with respect to the plane. Stability is guaranteed with the use of motors necessary to re-establish the condition of balance, through small movements to keep the center of gravity within the support base.
The aim of this project is therefore to create an efficient and adequate control system for balancing the robot, based on the principle of operation of the inverse pendulum.
The work presented concerns the entire development of the project, starting from the mechanical construction, from the choice of electronic components, to the design of an adequate control software.

# Details
Here are listed some details, taken from the report written (in italian).

## Platform

The microcontroller used is a PIC18F2580 produced by Microchip based on an 8bit Harvard architecture. The main features are:
• Power supply from 2.0V to 5.5V
• Maximum working frequency 8 MHz (32MHz with PLL x4)
• 768 bytes of RAM memory
• 3 ports (A, B, C) for a total of 24 I / O pins
• 4 timers
• 1 ADC, 8 lines available
• 1 CCP module (Capture, Compare, PWM)
• 1x MSSP8, 1x USART, 1x CAN
7 PIC18 microcontroller programmer and debugger 8 Master Synchronous Serial Port (SPI, I2C)
  
I decided to use the 32MHz PIC clock, for higher performances, by activating the internal PLL which multiplies the frequency of the 8MHz internal oscillator x4.
The peripherals used are the I2C interface from the MPU-6050 sensor (accelerometer and gyroscope), the USART interface for the Bluetooth module, the PWM module of the CCP for driving the motors and two interrupt pins for the acquisition of data from encoders.
