For the final project of high school, given my passion for robotics, I decided to devote myself to the study and construction of a self-balancing robot, a particular automaton able to keep itself balanced on two wheels, managing to win the their condition of instability. 
The condition of equilibrium is achieved through the use of sensors capable of detecting, moment by moment, the angle with respect to the plane. Stability is guaranteed with the use of motors necessary to re-establish the condition of balance, through small movements to keep the center of gravity within the support base.
The aim of this project is therefore to create an efficient and adequate control system for balancing the robot, based on the principle of operation of the inverse pendulum.
The work presented concerns the entire development of the project, starting from the mechanical construction, from the choice of electronic components, to the design of an adequate control software.
